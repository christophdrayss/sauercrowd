# sauercrowd DAO

![sauercrowdDao](./resources/logo.path)

sauercrowd is the first crowdfunding Investment DAO for European Startups and SMEs. The DAO runs as a parachain inside the Polkadot environment, using Parity Substrate and WASM. The boilerplate code is forged from https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.

Investors can buy Governance Tokens, aka "sauerTokens" in order to receive investment recommendations from other Investors.

Investment recommendations are submitted as a proposal alongside an investment memorandum and a DDD ("decentralized data room").

Each sauerToken holder can vote in favor to allocate DOTs into the respective investment.

## Contributions & Code of Conduct

Please follow the contributions guidelines as outlined in [`docs/CONTRIBUTING.adoc`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.adoc). In all communications and contributions, this project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Security

The security policy and procedures can be found in [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md).

## License

- Substrate Primitives (`sp-*`), Frame (`frame-*`) and the pallets (`pallets-*`), binaries (`/bin`) and all other utilities are licensed under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE-APACHE2).
- Substrate Client (`/client/*` / `sc-*`) is licensed under [GPL v3.0 with a classpath linking exception](LICENSE-GPL3).

The reason for the split-licensing is to ensure that for the vast majority of teams using Substrate to create feature-chains, then all changes can be made entirely in Apache2-licensed code, allowing teams full freedom over what and how they release and giving licensing clarity to commercial teams.

In the interests of the community, we require any deeper improvements made to Substrate's core logic (e.g. Substrate's internal consensus, crypto or database code) to be contributed back so everyone can benefit.
